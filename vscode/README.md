Recommended Extensions
----------------------

VSCode works out of the box for Front End development, among of which there are code autocompletion, 
Emmet, and basic linting. Therefore, there are not many extensions required to install.

These are some recommnded extension to enhance productivity and to close the gap with ST3:

- Align
- change-case
- EditorConfig for VS code
- ESLint
- Quick and Simple Text Selection
- stylelint
- Sublime Text Keymap (to quickly move on from ST3)
